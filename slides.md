# Basic idea: mesh networks

![adhoc network](adhoc.png)

 * your router at home doesn't want to be alone
 * it's not only about internet access
 * Freifunk continues to work when the internet is down
 * hard time for fans of censorship
 * self-healing: one router goes down -> another one can fill the gap

# Network + wifi basics in 10 minutes

---

# Wifi

 * electro-magnetic wave: light, radio, satellites, mobile phones, wifi,
   bluetooth, ...
 * currently 2 frequency bands for wifi:
    * 2.4GHz (channels 1-13)
    * 5GHz (channels 36-140)
 * two important wifi modes:
    * adhoc (all participants can communicate directly if in range)
    * access point with clients (AP coordinates everything)
 * for applications, wifi looks like a cable network (*ethernet*)
 * but: wifi often has severe packet loss due to bad signals!

---

# Antennas

 * Antennas differ
    * Dipole (see your home router)
    * Dish
    * Panel
    * ...

---

# Data transmission

 * data is transmitted in packets/frames between devices
 * packets/frames have a source and a destination address
 * OSI model layers:
    1. physical layer: wifi, twisted pair, fiber, ...
    2. data link layer: usually local area, exchange of *frames*,
       MAC addresses (ethernet), *example MAC address: 0e:d9:63:1a:a5:83*
    3. network layer: internet, exchange of *packets*, IP-addresses,
       routing between subnets, *example IP address: 10.230.42.42*
    4. ...

# Routing protocols @ Freifunk

 * get to know your neighbors!
 * 2 major routing protocols are used
    * **batman advanced**
        * layer 2
        * deals with MAC-addresses
        * a batman network works like a huge LAN
    * **OLSR**
        * layer 3
        * deals with IP-addresses
        * an OLSR network works like the internet at its core
